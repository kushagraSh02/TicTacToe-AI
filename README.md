# TicTacToe-AI
A Tic Tac Toe game that can be played with AI (minimax) or pvp.

The AI part is implemented using minimax algorithm. 

Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally. It is widely used in two player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Backgammon, Mancala, Chess, etc. In our program, the ai acts as a minimizer and tries to minimize the maximum score of the player.

We can also play the game against other players.

### Important Keys:
```
1. r - reset game
2. g - gamemode (ai or pvp)
3. 0 - random ai
4. 1 - minimax ai (smart)
```
